M\+OS, or Maintainable R\+T\+OS, is a simple and lightweight R\+T\+OS microkernel for the A\+RM Cortex M series that supports basic threading and I\+PC primitives.

It is a work in progress and is intended for \char`\"{}fun personal projects.\char`\"{}

M\+OS was originally developed on a S\+T\+Microelectronics S\+T\+M32\+F4 Discovery and has been tested on the following boards\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+T\+M32\+F767\+ZI Nucleo-\/144 (A\+RM Cortex M7)
\item S\+T\+M32\+L562 Discovery Kit (A\+RM Cortex M33)
\item S\+T\+M32\+F4 Discovery (A\+RM Cortex M4F)
\item S\+T\+M32\+G071\+RB Nucleo (A\+RM Cortex M0+)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Design Goals\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item R\+T\+OS\+: Hard priorities and bounded execution.
\item Short critical sections.
\item Simple configuration with low use of conditional compilation.
\item Tick reduction ({\itshape i.\+e.\+:} the so-\/called \char`\"{}tickless\char`\"{} operation).
\item Small code size ({\itshape e.\+g.\+:} mos/kernel$\ast$.c compiled size is $\sim$5\+KB).
\item Static kernel and (optionally) static application.
\item Easily customizable.
\item Provide example B\+S\+Ps and example applications.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Included Primitives\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recursive mutex with priority inheritance
\item Semaphores (counting / multi-\/bit binary)
\item Message queues (multi-\/priority)
\item Sys\+Tick-\/based timers
\end{DoxyItemize}

Included Optional Modules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heap
\item Shared context (cooperative multitasking where clients share same thread and message queue, intended for small memory footprints)
\item Logging
\item Command shell
\item Test bench
\end{DoxyItemize}

Supported toolchains / architectures\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+CC
\item A\+RM M0/\+M1/\+M0+ (Arch v6-\/M)
\item A\+RM M3/\+M4/\+M7 (Arch v7-\/M)
\item A\+RM M4\+F/\+M7F (Arch v7-\/M with hardware floating point using lazy stacking)
\item A\+RM M23/\+M33/\+M55 (Arch v8-\/M) -\/ currently supporting a single security mode\+: secure or non-\/secure.
\item Trust\+Zone can be used with interrupts disabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Future
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Better documentation...
\item Support Context switches in Trust\+Zone
\item C++ bindings
\end{DoxyItemize}

Features it probably W\+I\+LL N\+E\+V\+ER have\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Full M\+PU support
\item Non-\/\+A\+RM architecture support
\item Non-\/\+G\+CC toolchain support 
\end{DoxyItemize}
